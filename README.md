# library_app

An app built with HTML, CSS, and javascript where users can add or remove books they have (or are going to) read.

The app will have a basic form submission where users can input data regarding a book, such as the title, author, pages, and if they have read the book. Upon submission of this form, an object will be created with that data and then stored in an array that (may or may not) contain other books. The contents of this array will be displayed on screen as a list of books. The user will have the ability to delete books or change the read status. The displayed list will update accordingly.
